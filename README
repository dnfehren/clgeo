command line tool for geocoding lists of addresses

requires the pygeo module available at http://code.google.com/p/geopy
pygeo is installable with pip as well.


Opens a csv sheet and geocodes addresses using googles maps api but is limited by the public API restrictions to 2500 geocoding actions per day.

If the script is in your bin directory (without the file extension) the command to use tool looks like 'clgeo file.csv [--header N] [--adr_loc N N]', otherwise python clgeo.py etc.

optional parameter --header n allows for the skipping of header rows in the sheet, EX --header 2 would skip the first two rows, --header 0 skips no rows. The default is to skip the first row.

optional parameter --adr_loc n n n+ allows for the combination of multiple columns of data to create a full address. EX --adr_loc 0 1 3 would combine columns 0, 1 and 3 into one string before submitting the address to google. The default is to look for the full address in the first column.
